üéØ TARGET ARCHITECTURE: 3-Stage Sequential Chain
Chain Flow Definition
 (VG-Secbot1) ‚Üí FT (fine-tuned-model) ‚Üí  (VG-Secbot2) ‚Üí Final Output
Component Functions:

secbot1: (Prompt Engineer - existing VG-Secbot)
FT: SST technique execution (fine-tuned transformation model)
secbot2: Legal synthesis and final interpretation (new VG-Secbot instance)

Technical Implementation Requirements

Platform: POE Server Bots via Modal deployment
Cost Strategy: Modal credits-first, local fallback if needed
Chain Logic: Strictly linear, no branching/parallel execution
Context Passing: Accumulated context through all three stages


üîß CURRENT DRBANGER STATUS
Existing 2-Stage Implementation ‚úÖ
pythonVG-Secbot (Research) ‚Üí Qwen3-32B-nitro (Analysis) ‚Üí Output
Working Components:

Request Construction: model_copy() method functional
Context Accumulation: Research results ‚Üí Combined context
Stream Processing: Live output during chain execution
Error Handling: Hard-error approach for clean debugging

Required Modifications for 3-Stage

Remove Qwen: Replace with FT model call
Add Third Stage: Insert secbot2 after FT processing
Context Management: Pass accumulated context through all stages
Bot Dependencies: Update server_bot_dependencies configuration


‚ö° DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
Modal-First Approach

Credits Available: $5 remaining, burn-test strategy
Platform Integration: Modal-GitHub connector established
Fallback Plan: Local deployment if Modal credits exhausted
Technical Barrier Policy: Retreat immediately, avoid time-wasting

FT Model Deployment Requirements

Current Status: GGUF version available locally
Deployment Need: Convert/upload for Modal integration
Alternative Options: Custom POE bot or external API call
Decision Criteria: Setup speed vs. resource efficiency


üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
Phase 1: DRBanger Code Modification
TASK: Expand 2-stage to 3-stage chain
INPUT: Current DRBanger.py with VG-Secbot ‚Üí Qwen flow
OUTPUT: secbot1 ‚Üí FT ‚Üí secbot2 chain implementation
REQUIREMENTS: Preserve existing context-passing logic
Phase 2: FT Model Integration
TASK: Deploy fine-tuned model for chain integration
INPUT: Local GGUF model files
OUTPUT: Modal-accessible or POE custom bot
REQUIREMENTS: SST technique execution capability
Phase 3: Bot Configuration
TASK: Update POE server bot dependencies
INPUT: Current 2-bot configuration
OUTPUT: 3-bot setup with FT model included
REQUIREMENTS: Maintain existing VG-Secbot functionality


Technical References

Chain Architecture: Sequential, not parallel
Context Flow: Additive accumulation through stages
Error Strategy: Fast retreat on technical barriers
Cost Model: Fixed subscription vs. variable inference


üéØ SUCCESS METRICS
Immediate Goals

Working 3-Stage Chain: FT model integrated successfully
Context Preservation: Information flows correctly through stages
Output Quality: Novel legal interpretations generated
Deployment Stability: Chain runs without errors

Academic Integration

Thesis Timeline: Final month completion support
Novel Interpretations: Citation-worthy legal insights
Technical Demonstration: Working AI system for supervisor
Panel Presentation: Comprehensible yet sophisticated system


üîÑ NEXT SESSION PROTOCOL
Ready Assets

DRBanger.py: Base code for modification
FT Model: Local files ready for deployment
Modal Integration: GitHub connector established
POE Configuration: Platform access confirmed

Immediate Priorities

Clean Repository: Remove unnecessary files from DRBang repo
Code Modification: Expand DRBanger to 3-stage architecture
FT Deployment: Get fine-tuned model accessible to chain
Integration Testing: Verify complete chain functionality

Technical Support Strategy

Codex Integration: Use for code modifications
Cloud Code Access: Local directory integration available
Task-Based Approach: Frame requirements for non-conversational models
Retreat Protocol: Immediate fallback on technical barriers


Status: Architecture defined, deployment strategy confirmed, technical requirements mapped. Ready for implementation execution with Modal-first approach and local fallback. üöÄ
